# Thinking in React TS

This code is an adaptation of the react documentation [thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react), rewritten in TypeScript. Its purpose is to serve as a guide for team workflow directions and best practices in maintaining a proper file structure.

The components included in this project have been thoroughly tested using [jest](https://github.com/jestjs/jest) and [RTL](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library).

For detailed test coverage, you can refer to [this link](https://huckbit.github.io/thinking-in-react-TS/).
